This "tracker" is intended as an alternative to hints. It will tell you when you have all important checks in a world. Any world with 0 checks will tell you immediately. Everything on Redbuddhas tracker is an important check other than Ansem reports since there are no hints. When you get a check click the plus to the right of the world and then click what you got.

To read the pnach you need to run the program once the it will create the folder you put it in in appdata. 
C:\Users\\(username)\AppData\LocalLow\DefaultCompany\Alternative to Hints Tracker 
Replace username with yours and you can copy and paste it into explorer or use the "run" program type in appdata and manually navigate to it place the pnach in the folder

Alternatively you can copy this path
%APPDATA%\\..\LocalLow\DefaultCompany\Alternative to Hints Tracker
and paste it into windows explorer and it should take you directly to the folder the pnach goes in.
Thanks to Tommmadness for this since im dumb.

After downloaded the tracker for the very first time you will have to run it once to be able to get to the folder since it needs to be created. Once the pnach is in the folder you will need to restart the program since it only reads the pnach on startup. Any pnach name valaxors website provides a download for will work but it must only be the name from the website no extra numbers names or spaces.
